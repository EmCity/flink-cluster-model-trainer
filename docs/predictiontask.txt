### Specification of the prediction problem of KDD cup 2017 Task 1

The prediction task is to infer a prediction of average travel_times for six 20-min time windows in a 2-hour window based on information from the previous 2 hours.
The model is trained with historical data from 19.07 - 17.10. 

Let n be the dimensionality of the vector representation of each training example.
Let m be the dimensionality of the vector representation of the prediction output.
The machine learning task is therefore a map from R:n -> R:m

### Specification of input vector:
[hour, minute, weekday, link1_window1_avg_travel_time, link1_window2_avg_travel_time, .... link1_window_i_avg_travel_time, ....linkK_window_i_avg_travel_time, pressure, sea_pressure, wind_direction, wind_speed, temperature, rel_humidity, precipitation, link1_width, ... link6_width]

with n = 10 + i * 6 + 6
with each each of the k links being divided up into i time windows where the travel time is aggregated (The number i can be chosen arbitrarily, but has to be chosen with reason to not blow up the vector to huge dimensions)

### Specification of output vector:
[route1_avg_travel_time(time_window_1), routeB_avg_travel_time(time_window_1), ... , route6_avg_travel_time(time_window_6)]

with 6 time windows (20-min time windows in 2 hours)
and 6 routes (A-2, A-3, B-1, B-3, C-1, C-3)
m = 6 * 6

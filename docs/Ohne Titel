### Specification of the prediction problem of KDD cup 2017 Task 1

The prediction task is to infer a prediction p which has the form
[intersection_id, tollgate_id, time_window, avg_travel_time]
where time_window is a tuple [start_time, end_time] with an interval of 20 mins

Let n be the dimensionality of the vector representation of each training example.
Let m be the dimensionality of the vector representation of the prediction output.
The machine learning task is therefore a map from R:n -> R:m

### Specification of input vector:
[hour, minute, weekday, link1_window1_avg_travel_time, link1_window2_avg_travel_time, .... link1_window_i_avg_travel_time, ....linkK_window_i_avg_travel_time, pressure, sea_pressure, wind_direction, wind_speed, temperature, rel_humidity, precipitation, link1_width, ... linkK_width]

with n = 10 + i * k + k * n
with each each of the k links being divided up into i time windows where the travel time is aggregated

### Specification of output vector:
[route1_avg_travel_time(time_window_1), routeB_avg_travel_time(time_window_1), ... , route12_avg_travel_time(time_window_42)]
with a = no_routes = 12
and w = no_windows_per_route = 42
and m = no_routes * no_time_windows = 12 * 42 = 505
